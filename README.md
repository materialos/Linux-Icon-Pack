### Packages

#### Arch
Arch users can install this community maintained [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/materialos-icon-theme-git/).

#### Ubuntu
The best way to install the Icon Pack on Ubuntu is to use our [ppa](https://launchpad.net/~materialos/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

If you can't install the theme using the ppa on ubuntu, its probably because a new version of ubuntu is out and phil didn't update the recipe for the ppa. so [send him an email](mailto:phil@philippeloctaux.com) and tell him to get his shit together and fix that!

Fire up a terminal and run these commands:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:materialos/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install materialos-icon-theme-linux
```

#### Fedora
We'd love to have our icon pack on Fedora!
If you know or know someone who can make a package, it would be awesome! Feel free to contact us!
